<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

FanNews Search Website

This News Search Website is my second project in the Web Development Immersive Program at Per Scholas. It is my version of News Search. Here is the github-pages website link: "https://fan0703.github.io/react-app/"


App Function

News Search Website is a simple news app  which uses NewsAPI to fetch news from the API. You could input keywords in Search bar to get News.

Built With: REACT CSS Javascript

How I built this website:

First, I apply for a API key on this site : "https://newsapi.org/ ". And I use axios to fetch news from newsapi, at this time , I can change the word after query to get different news.

Second, I add a search bar to realize input keywords in the search bar to get fresh news.

Next, I create a nav bar with FanNews, about ,sign in these three parts. I use react-router-dom to link to different page.

Last, I do some styling for my webpage, try to make the code as dry as I possibly could, making reusable functions and calling them in use hook.

All in all, this project helped me understand the knowledge better, looking back on the homework and labs, everything makes so much more sense... Go figure...

Acknowledgements

I'd like to thank our trainer, Tishana Trainor and Manara Ali and my classmate Mark for helping me solve the problems.
