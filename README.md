FanNews Search Website

This News Search Website is my second project in the Web Development Immersive Program at Per Scholas. It is my version of News Search. Here is the github-pages website link: "https://fan0703.github.io/react-app/"


App Function

News Search Website is a simple news app  which uses NewsAPI to fetch news from the API. You could input keywords in Search bar to get News.

Built With: REACT CSS Javascript

How I built this website:

First, I apply for a API key on this site : "https://newsapi.org/ ". And I use axios to fetch news from newsapi, at this time , I can change the word after query to get different news.

Second, I add a search bar to realize input keywords in the search bar to get fresh news.

Next, I create a nav bar with FanNews, about ,sign in these three parts. I use react-router-dom to link to different page.

Last, I do some styling for my webpage, try to make the code as dry as I possibly could, making reusable functions and calling them in use hook.

All in all, this project helped me understand the knowledge better, looking back on the homework and labs, everything makes so much more sense... Go figure...
